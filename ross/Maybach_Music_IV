on a Lear","Or get a new car, I could lease it for a year","Or bring it back tomorrow, that's a lease that disappear","Count new money, peeling out a venue","New Maybach after it was discontinued","Never question mine, my mind is so inventive","Quadrupled my net worth and threw in a few incentives","Maybach IV the allure that I adore","All money game, we got ones in the floor","See me on the wood, nigga, pause at the game","Two mil, the jewels, no flaws, ask them lames","Bow to the boss in the presence of a don","Started on the corner nigga, didn't have a coin","Playing my position for a club that I can join\nNever in the draft, but that boy know he going","Throw me a bomb, get me a brick","That's on the Quran I'mma go and get the chips","Go and get a rental, I got a cute bitch\nShe's showing some potential, so we taking trips","Nigga, assets last while memories fade","I'mma bust that ass, I don't get paid","I'm a Mike Tyson type of typewriter sniper","Double M life 'til a nigga pay the piper","I love when the beat dip","Same way I love to see a key flip","Go and pay your mama house off\nGet sucked off, shorty wipe your mouth off","I'm alive, you could never write the South off","South paw, box a nigga off like a outlaw","Quick thinker, big better shut your mouth boi","Black chips, gold bottles ship it out raw","Pulling up slow, look at that boy","Young B.I.G., Lil Kim on tour","Lil Cease with me, all the cheese with me","All the g's with me, Maybach Eazy-E","[Interlude]","The good times don't last long\nJust rewind the last song","We all shared some great times\nAs I read some great rhymes","[Ne-Yo]","What we does, is what dreams are made of","Come and get your love, all of this love","[Verse 2]","500 for the car that I got on the strip","That's another 100, what I got on my wrist","800 for the jar that I'm about to twist","It's a female strand, you know life's a bitch","As I get high, move my curtains to the side","Age like fine wine, ambitions they never die","Niggas get abused like boys at Penn State","Greatest that ever did it, decided my own fate","[Ne-Yo]","Dreams, everything that we are","The life that we're living, baby it's ours","Dreams, money, homes, and cars","Baby that's a given, I'm talking about every fantasy","Be good real with me, still don't mean something, ooohhh, oh","Baby come with me and live the dream","[Outro]","It's a whole nother different element","It's Maybach roman numeral four","You couldn't fathom this, you couldn't imagine this\nYou can't produce this, you won't reproduce this","I'll be dreaming of you\nI'll be dreaming of you\nYou'll be making it come true\nI'll be dreaming of you\nI'll be dreaming of you\nI'll be dreaming of you\nYou'll be making it come true\nI'll be dreaming of you","[LA Reid]","Yessir","This is LA Reid","It takes a boss to know a boss","It takes greatness to recognize greatness","Ricky Ross, the boss, Maybach
