I just wanted me a piece\nSlice of cheesecake before my niggas all deceased","These boys snort lines, I'm fine just sipping wine","Amsterdam in the air, tomorrow on my mind","[Hook]","I'm Berry Gordy to the streets","With a kilo, so that boy had been a beast","I wanna be there when each one of my kids born\nRoyal blood, hundred acres each to live on","Real nigga to the day that I'm deceased\nEven then I pray I'm living through these beats","Dope boy, you can tell by my sneaks","Burning Amsterdam green where it falls like a leaf","[Verse 2]","Born in the bricks with the short end of the stick\nAlways running late, quick to show up with your bitch","The Hublot's cool but my Terminator's foolish","All stainless steel, quick to match it with my tool"," and","Red carpet event, the marijuana be lit","Red or blue, do you, as long as you're getting rich","Crack game, champagne, kilos on the stock exchange","Rolls Royce, new Ghost, that's a nigga pocket change","These niggas acting like they want a war!\nWhen it come to whacking niggas I done won awards","Nigga, you a bitch, where yo' Honda Accord?\nI'm riding in some shit only I can afford","Shouldn't claim the hood til you build a rapport","Amsterdam state of mind:"," ","I just gave you a tour\nI'm laughing at the people who label me poor","Now I piss on Europeans, you'd think it was porn","[Hook]","[Outro]","I'm speaking on unwritten laws -- the code of the streets","I'm not the type of nigga that you bump into at a 7-11 and just pull your pistol on him","And do what the fuck you want to do","Niggas like me, you gotta get permission homie!","And that could take a long time!\nIn that time, I'mma handle my muthafuckin business..\nUgh! Ugh!","It's the red light district, nigga this Amsterdam","Wherever the fuck I'm at\nIt's a no go\nWe greenlight you bitch niggas","Rozay!"]}{"media":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx9yYfn9h3k","lyrics":["[Intro: Teedra Moses]","We get ghost, you already know what it is","Money stuffed in my bag","Maybach shit!","Cameras in the ceiling, Céline on my arm","[Verse 1]","Bright lights and dark corners as night embark on us","Refugees running wild, Wyclef with a SIG Sauer","Nothing to lose, I was starving from the start","Now the same cat driving Jaguars","Open fire when you see me"," yell out and make em whisper","The club that I'm a member, they'll be gone by November","Keys to the city got killers who slither with me","Lamborghini, middle of the ghetto, smoke a fat fifty","Billionaire bid, wrists on chill","Standing in the field of dreams, tryna see a hundred mil","These boys going blind they just happy being free","In a world of so many I just wanted me a key","Sheesh!
