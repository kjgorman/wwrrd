Pick a time tonight","Back to these bitches following my timeline\nBack to these crackers following my timeline","Got the phone tapped, I think I'm being followed","Touch him with the Holy Ghost, can you hear me Father?","[Diddy]","Father, please protect me from brokeness","And bitch ass niggas, Bitch ass bitches too\nKeep 'em away","[Hook: Rick Ross] x2","[Verse 2: Rick Ross]","Work! That's all my niggas workin' with\nWork! That's all my niggas lurkin' with","My teacher told me that I was a piece of shit\nSeen her the other day, driving a piece of shit","Work! Exactly what I'm screamin' ho","Certified, 8 digit nigga, triple beamin' ho","You talkin' to the Holy Ghost\nI'm smokin' 'til I overdose","When I fuck she let her pussy soak","Even my lawyer be askin is it dope","Never break the code shock me with a million volts","I'm forever dope, touched by the holy ghost","[Diddy]","You see, they hate what they don't understand","Father, forgive them\nFor they know not what they do","Let's go","[Hook: Rick Ross]"]}
