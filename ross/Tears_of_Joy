mirror but I don't see much","Still running the streets so I don't sleep much","Watching the snakes so they don't creep up,"," ","but the way\nI'm gettin this money niggas can't keep up,"," ","you niggas can't keep up","Niggas got beef but it can’t be much\nI'm still walking through the crowds like I can't be touched","Top back all black Gretzky puck","Ice skater lil' later might let me fuck,"," ","damn she might let me fuck","Last night I cried tears of joy\nWhat did I do to deserve this?","Vacheron on my wrist a year ago\nI didn't even know the bitch exist\nQuarter milli for the mothafucka\nNo insurance on the mothafucka","Ain't life a bitch, but you gotta keep her wet\nKeys open doors so I gotta keep a set","Everybody know that I'm a lotta people's threat","Biggie Smalls in the flesh livin' life after my death","Yesterday I read my horoscope","Tell me Lord will I be poor and broke\nTell me Lord will I be dealing dope","I wanna take my momma to the Poconos,"," ","but only the Lord knows","[Hook: Cee-Lo]","To all the loved ones I leave behind\nAt least they can't see me cry\nAnd I ask, when someone wants to be me why\nThought having everything would ease my mind\nIf you could read my mind\nMy God, I'm scarred, I have tattoo tears of joy","[Verse 2]","Last night I cried tears of joy\nWhat did I do to deserve this?","Young rich motherfucker still uneducated\nBut dammit a nigga made it,"," ","goddamn a nigga made it","Crib bigger than a church, Lord know I'm blessed","Five different lawyers, Lord know I’m stressed","A punch in the face get you 300K, ask Vlad\nNow he back to making minimum wage, another victim of my criminal ways","I wanna walk in the image of Christ","But that bitch Vivica nice","And I'm still swimming in ice","I'm just living my life, I'm just living my life","Lease a Lamborghini for your pussy rate","Life is just a pussy race","Snatch a bitch take her back to your place\nNext morning I can tell you how the pussy taste",", ","I got expensive taste","[Hook]","[Verse 3]","Last night I cried tears of joy\nWhat did we do to deserve this?","Not to dwell on the the past but to keep it real","I gotta represent for Emmett Till,"," ","all the dead souls in the field","Lookin at my Rollie it's about that time","White man had a problem with mine","And we suppose to be shy?","The revolutions televised,"," ","Bobby still on the rise","[Hook]"]}{"media":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj_eYRMac04","lyrics":["[Intro]","Smokin' a fat spliff in a brand new Benz","No I.D. on the track let the story begin, begin","[Verse
