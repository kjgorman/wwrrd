","[Excerpt from the movie \"Baby Boy\"]","\"Come on let's pray: Dear Lord...\nPlease forgive us for all the sins we have brought upon us\nAnd look down upon us with forgiveness for all the sins we will have in the future\nI know you understand that niggas ain't perfect, but we try, Lord\nWe try to keep our heads up in bad times\nThis is a bad time; show us the way\nAnd if you can't show us the way\nThen forgive us for being lost","{*gunshots*}
