figments of my imagination\nWhoever figured the figures this figure would be making","Plenty cream, my women pose like figurines","Whips weaving through traffic the triple black centipedes","Please let a nigga breathe","Dilated pupils are the seeds of a niggas greed","With 20 g's in my denim jeans","If she fucking me she lucky just to get some chucky cheese","I bust my nut and holla lucky me","Its tatted in my vein I remain sucker free","My vocal like an atom bomb in the Avalon","Black roses for singing the saddest song","As-Salāmu `Alaykum to paper","Walaikum Salam","Im the don inshallah, now pour me my Dom","Being gangstas a cold job\nWack a nigga go rejoice with a blow job","Always wanted Rolls Royce with no job","Then again all I fear is a dope charge","All I fear is a dope charge","Tell me whats the odds for appeals for a dope boy","Who shed tears for a dope boy","Oh what happens to the kids of the dope boy\nOrphans, fucking orphans\nBorn defending so nigga never been on offense","Now its mo shrimp, nigga order more shrimp","My neighbourhood a rackett I practice my importance","You know we hustle to the key of life","Moving weed and white before we learn to read and write","So fuck a tutor pay attention to my shooter","Fucking me today but next she be fucking Luda","We assholes with fast cars and cash flow","My last loaf was gift wrapped by Castro","I did it all but the blow was my specialty","Mental telepathy directly in my recipe","Ahh, 2 mill on my second home\nStill stepping on a couple bricks of that methadone","I got a method for getting money like RZA do","Resurrected big poppa in the physical","Reincarnated the realest I'm getting revenue","10 mill borrowed from my peers in the federal\nAnd thats several for slinging in Atlanta","But the way they dress you never knew\nThought they seen a better view","But the feds had a rat name Reginald\nThat put em on a pedestal the conviction was incredible","The moral of the story was\nAin't no happy ending for a thug","I think of 2Pac, I think of Biggie now\nLook how they getting down, I went and bought a 50 Cal","We all go when we gotta go","My Glock hole bigger than Nicki Minaj camel toe","So let the panel know we back, the commission intact\nTeflon don and all black for filling contracts","I'm only here to supersede my successors","RIP ","Paul Castellano",", ","Meyer Lansky",", ","Bumpy Johnson",", ","Al Capone","T-Rogers",", ","Tookie Williams",", ","Carlo Gambino"," and last but not least ","John Gotti\nTeflon Don","(Ross, Ross,
